Description: # Adventure Text Game Engine
        An easy way to create rpg text games using Python.

        ## Getting Started
        1) Install Python 3.9 or newer. https://www.python.org/downloads/
        2) Open cmd/terminal and install the newest version from git by typing:
        
                mkdir mygame
                cd mygame
                pip install git+https://github.com/younessidbakkasse/TextGameEngine 
        
        
        
        If you want to easily edit the source, it's recommended to clone the git
        repo and install as develop like this. Make sure you have git installed. https://git-scm.com/
        
                git clone https://github.com/younessidbakkasse/TextGameEngine
        
        Also install pygame module using this command:
        
                pip install pygame
        
        
        On some systems you might have to use pip3 instead of pip in order to use Python 3 and not the old Python 2.
        
        
        ## Dependencies
          * pygame 1.9+
          
          
        ## Examples
        ``` python
        from manager import *            # this will import everything we need from the engine manager with just one line.
        
        game = Game()
        
        game.scenes['First Scene'] = StoryScene(
                name = 'first scene',  #the name is required so that you can link scenes with each others.
                buttons = [['Start the game', 'second scene', 'normal']],  #the first element is the text on the button
                text = "The front door has been left slightly ajar. Partialy broken, it may have been opened by force." # the scene text
        ),
        
        game.run()                       # opens a window and starts the game.
        ```
        
        
        ## How do I make a game?
        This game engine is writing in 100% Python code. You can use any text editor you want, but personally I like to use Vscode.
        1) Create an empty .py file called 'my_game.py' avoid names like game.py, manager.py, scene.py
        2) Copy this text into your new file:
        ``` python
        from manager import *            # this will import everything we need from the engine manager with just one line.
        
        game = Game()
        
        game.scenes['First Scene'] = StoryScene(
                name = 'first scene',  #the name is required so that you can link scenes with each others.
                buttons = [['Start the game', 'second scene', 'normal']],  #the first element is the text on the button
                text = "The front door has been left slightly ajar. Partialy broken, it may have been opened by force." # the scene text
        ),
        
        game.run()                       # opens a window and starts the game.
        ```
        
        3) Type this in the terminal to start the game:
        
               python my_game.py
           If you use Vscode, I recommend installing the python extension to tun on your scripts with the press of a button.
        
        4) you can now control the game there a gui button such as inventory or profile, you can exit the game using the menu
        selection exit game.
        
        5) to link two scenes you need to create a sceond scene exemple below, and add it's name to the button destination list parameter, so when you click the button you directly convert the second scene.
        
        ``` python
        from manager import *            # this will import everything we need from the engine manager with just one line.
        
        game = Game()
        
        game.scenes['First Scene'] = StoryScene(
                name = 'first scene',  #the name is required so that you can link scenes with each others.
                buttons = [['Start the game', 'second scene', 'normal']],  #the first element is the text on the button
                text = "The front door has been left slightly ajar. Partialy broken, it may have been opened by force." # the scene text
        ),
        
        game.scenes['Second Scene'] = StoryScene(
                name = 'second scene',  #the name is required so that you can link scenes with each others.
                buttons = [
                        ['Fight the dragon', 'third scene', 'fight-wild dog'], #first button
                        ['Run away', 'third scene', 'normal'] # second button
                ],  
                # here third scene is not yet created
                text = "You just met a wild dog do you want to fight him or run away" # the scene text
        ),
        
        game.run()                       # opens a window and starts the game.
        ```
